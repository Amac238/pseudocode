Short Answer
Why do programmers use pseudocode?
If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

1. You use pseudocode to brainstorm and develop algorithms.
2. Nothing. pseudocode is not a programming language, so it would not run on a computer.
3.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater than the second number
    PRINT first number
ELSE
    PRINT second number
END IF

4.

INIT total to 0
WHILE the number is not 100
  PRINT number
  ADD number to total
END WHILE

5.

FUNCTION findEntry (input NAME parameter)
  SET phonebook to an ARRAY with names
  FOR each entry in the phonebook
    IF entry equals NAME parameter
      RETURN that name  
    END IF
  END FOR
  RETURN "No match found"
END FUNCTION

6.

function findEntry(name){
  var phonebook = ['Austin', 'Steve', 'LeAnne', 'Aubree'];
  for (var i = 0; i < phonebook.length; i++){

   if (phonebook[i] === name) {
    return "We found a match: " +  "  " + name;
   } 
  }
    return ' no match found ';
 }

findEntry('Steve'); //in phonebook
findEntry('jake'); //not in phonebook
