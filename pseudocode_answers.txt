Short Answer
Why do programmers use pseudocode?
If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

1. You use pseudocode to brainstorm and develop algorithms.
2. Nothing. pseudocode is not a programming language, so it would not run on a computer.
3.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater than the second number
    PRINT first number
ELSE
    PRINT second number
END IF

4.

INIT total to 0
WHILE the number is not 100
  PRINT number
  ADD number to total
END WHILE

5.

INPUT name
IF name is in phonebook
    return entry 
ELSE
    return 'Not in Phonebook'
END IF

6.

var name = prompt('Please enter the name you are looking for', 'Who are you looking for?')

if (name == phonebook.names){
    return phonebook.entry;
}
else {
    return('The person you are looking for is not in the phonebook.');
}
